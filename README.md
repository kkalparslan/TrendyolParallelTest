# Parallel testing is a testing approach where multiple tests are executed simultaneously. 
# Parallel testing is typically used in large and complex projects to reduce test durations, 
obtain fast feedback, and accelerate test cycles. In this approach, scenarios are executed in 
parallel across different devices, browsers, operating systems, or other test environments, 
enabling multiple scenarios to be completed at the same time.
# Parallel testing offers benefits such as optimizing test durations, quickly detecting errors and 
expediting test completion. However, managing parallel tests may involve challenges such as proper 
scenario decomposition, synchronization, resource utilization, and accurate analysis of results, 
requiring careful planning and implementation.

## In this framework, a parallel test study was carried out on the trendyol website ##
